# RoutePlanner-with-OpenStreetMap

Route Planner with OpenStreetMap is a C++ based project which used the A* Search algorith for finding the distance between two points on a map.

Here, we are using the OpenStreetMap data and the IO2D visualization library to build a route planner which is able to find the path between two points on a real-world map.

### Why Route Planner?

Route Planner plays a vital feature in today's world as we all are familiar with Google Maps, Apple Maps, Here Maps etc and we use them heavily to find our route from one place to another.

Have you ever wondered, how the services of these Map vendors work and how they are able to find the optimal path so fast when there are about infinite possible paths.

### Objective

The main objective for the project is to build a Route Planner which is able to find the path between two real points on a visualised Map.

The Sub-Objectives of the project are: 

* Developing the A* Algorithm.
* Fetching the Data from OpenStreetMap and using it with C++.
* Combining the A8 Search Algorithm on OpenStreetMap.
